# HarvestBands
My first attempt at recreating the back end of the Harvest Band Festival Website



The biggest thing going on here is that I created thi version of the website using some rudamentary methods. After familiarizing myself with the OWIN, AutoMapper, and nINject packages, I realized my project was too fragmented, and decided to start with a fresh implementation.

Any updates after 4.30.2015 are basically me using this defunct project as a sandbox for new ideas.
